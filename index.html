           <p>
             How? A word which creates but also inspires and defines an engineer. Modelling complex problems breaking them down to their principal components and designing a solution is key to under-standing and answering the how. The unique challenge which software engineering offers lends itself well to this philosophy, requiring an inquisitive mind to fully explore the depths of the creativity and craftsmanship required to overcome challenges.
          </p>
  
          <p>Being such a young industry, I feel that it offers the most in terms of a full-time learning experience for the rest of my life, allowing me to keep my mind engaged and interested. For the first time I feel like I can make something I can view as a hobby my job and hopefully create my own future business within this sector. I believe that Futureproof is the best place for me to develop my skills needed for software engineering.

           In my spare time I try to keep up a variety of hobbies. I'm dedicated to yoga and gym sessions(daily where possible). I play guitar and keep up with a variety of genres of music, from bands such as Metallica to John Mayer. I can often be seen travelling with my 35mm camera, something which I am looking at developing a website for to showcase my photos. Occasionally when I have a weekend spare I'll go surfing or casually game depending on any new releases.

    <h2 id="Experience">EXPERIENCE </h2>
      <p>In my work life I have always endeavoured to explore my creative side. My time at Reiss really allowed me to explore my passion within the fashion industry, getting to know clients’ needs and wants and form personal relationships to make them feel comfortable. This gave me the opportunity to pitch outfit ideas that they might not have initially thought of and allowed me to explore my own relationship with how differing styles could fit together, a skill I feel could be really useful as a developer. 
      <p>My time at Bristol Robotics Lab allowed me to explore my technical side. I worked as a research fellow testing a fuel named Plaxx, an alternative to standard diesel fuel, in a multi-cylinder engine. The research project was a comparison of plastic waste derived fuel, Plaxx, as an alternative to heavy and light fuel oil for power generation to Diesel. The research looked at developing the use of Plaxx to ensure that optimal engine performance, exhaust emissions and engine wear were established. My responsibilities in this project were as follows; </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Investigation and development of generalised model for diesel engine emissions characteristics running on Plaxx using Ricardo WAVE</li>
        <li>Selecting suitable sensors to condition monitor engine, creating and fitting an external fuel tank with suitable materials</li>
        <li>Give internal and external progress presentations as well as a finalised report</li>
      </ul>
